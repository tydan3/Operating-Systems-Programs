    The EXT filesystem(extended), written by RÃ©my Card, was released with
    Linux in 1992 to overcome size limitations of the Minix filesystem. The EXT4 
    filesystem provides improvements in performance, reliability, and capacity.
    
    Two most recently added features: casefold and encrypt
    
    encrypt enables file-system level encryption of data blocks and file names. 
    This is useful for file systems with multiple users and where not all files 
    should be encrypted.
