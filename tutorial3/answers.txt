Q. What file must be included to use the readdir() API?
       #include <dirent.h>

Q. How long does it take in milliseconds to run the original unmodified wtest.c program?
       real    0m0.001s
       user    0m0.001s
       sys     0m0.000s

Q. How long does it take in milliseconds to run the modified wtest.c program?
       real    0m0.001s
       user    0m0.001s
       sys     0m0.000s

Q. If the runtime of the modified program has changed, what is likely the cause?
       The runtime did not change. If the runtime did change, it would likely 
       be longer because fsync is a routine that forces writes to disk and does
       not return until all of the writes are complete.

Q. What is the difference between the inode number of the hard vs. the symbolic link?
       original: 2375337
       hard link: 2375337 
       symbolic link: 2365020
       The hard link's inode number is the same as the original file while the
       symbolic links inode number is different.

Q. What happens to the hard link when the original linked file is deleted?
       Nothing, the hard link appears to remain the same.

Q. What happens to the symbolic link when the original linked file is deleted?
       The symbolic link file can no longer be opened. It is a dangling
       reference now because the pathname it points to no longer exists.

Q. “update-alternatives” remaps the python command to point to the selected Python interpreter. How can
the selected interpreter be bypassed to run a program using python version 2?
       It can be bypassed by using the "update-alternatives" command to switch
       to python version 2, selecting option 1.

Q. Which /tmp directory had better sysbench throughput? The standard /tmp or the symbolically linked
/tmp that was created on a ramdisk? 
       The symbolically linked /tmp that was created on a ramdisk had better sysbench throughput.

Q. Please provide /tmp throughput numbers
       standard /tmp
       Throughput:
       read, MiB/s:                  34.22
       written, MiB/s:               22.81

       symbolically linked /tmp
       Throughput:
       read, MiB/s:                  2431.44
       written, MiB/s:               1620.96

Q. Which filesystem had the highest read/write throughput results measured in MiB/s?
       ext4 with journaling had the highest read/write throughput.

Q. Please report your read/write throughput values for all three tests:
ext2:
       Throughput:
       read, MiB/s:                  32.52
       written, MiB/s:               21.68
ext4 with journaling:
       Throughput:
       read, MiB/s:                  34.05
       written, MiB/s:               22.70
ext4 without journaling:
       Throughput:
       read, MiB/s:                  31.54
       written, MiB/s:               21.03

Q. One inode is created for every storage block on the disk. How large is this storage block size in KB for
which an inode is created? 
       4 KB

Q. How many inodes are created?
       25600 inodes

Q. What % of inodes are in use initially on the /mnt3 file system mount?
       1%

Q. What % of inodes are in use with the revised inode ratio on the /mnt3 file system mount?
       14%
